# Sinian  
Sinian is Alibaba’s compiler-based heterogeneous hardware acceleration platform, targeting extreme performance for machine learning applications. Interfacing with the upper level frameworks such as Alibaba PAI, Tensorflow , MxNet and etc, Sinian enables deep co-optimizations between software and hardware to deliver high execution efficiency for ML applications.  Sinian is fully tailorable (“statically and dynamically”) for cloud computing, edge computing, and IoT devices, making it easy to achieve performance portability between training and deploying machine learning models across heterogeneous accelerators.
